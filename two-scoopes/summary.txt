1. Coding style

    - Some approachs

        - Avoid abbreviating variable names.
        - Write out your function argument names.
        - Document your classes and methods.
        - Comment your code.
        - Refactor repeated lines of code into reusable functions or methods.
        - Keep functions and methods short. A good rule of thumb is that scrolling should not be necessary 
        to read an entire function or method.

    - The import order in a Django project is:

        1 Standard library imports.
        2 Imports from core Django.
        3 Imports from third-party apps including those unrelated to Django.
        4 Imports from the apps that you created as part of your Django project.

    - Table 1.1: Imports: Absolute vs. Explicit Relative

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |            Code                          Import Type                        Usage                                      |
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | from core.views import FoodMixin        absolute import      Use when importing from outside the current app           |
        | from .models import WaffleCone          explicit relative    Use when importing from another module in the current app |
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Use Underscores("_") in URL Pattern Names Rather Than Dashes


2. The optimal django environment setup

    - This chapter covered using the same database in development as in production, pip, virtualenv,
      venv, conda, poetry, pipenv, version control, and Docker. These are good to have
      in your tool chest, since they are commonly used not just in Django, but in the majority of
      Python software development.

    - We like to put all our environments in one directory and all our projects in another.
    
    ~/projects/icecreamratings_project/
    ~/.envs/icecreamratings/


4. Fundamentals of Django App Design

    - Vocabulary
        Django project:
            is a web application powered by the Django web framework.
        Django apps:
            are small libraries designed to represent a single aspect of a project. (A Django
            project is made up of many Django apps.)
        Installed apps: 
            is the list of Django apps used by a given project available in its
            INSTALLED_APPS setting.
        Third-party Django packages:
            are simply pluggable, reusable Django apps that have been
            packaged with the Python packaging tools
    
    - Each Django app should be tightly-focused on its own task and possess a simple, easy-to-remember name. If an app
      seems too complex, it should be broken up into smaller apps.


5. Settings and Requirements Files

    - Best Practices

        - All settings files need to be version-controlled. This is especially true in production
          environments, where dates, times, and explanations for settings changes absolutely
          must be tracked.

        - Don’t Repeat Yourself. You should inherit from a base settings file rather than
          cutting-and-pasting from one file to another(base.py, local.py, prod.py, stg.py).

            icecreamratings_project/         
            └── config/           
                ├── settings/
                └── ├── __init__.py
                    ├── base.py
                    ├── local_audreyr.py
                    ├── local_pydanny.py
                    ├── local.py
                    ├── staging.py
                    ├── test.py
                    └── production.py

            `python manage.py shell --settings=config.settings.local`
            `python manage.py runserver --settings=config.settings.local`

        - Keep secret keys safe. They should be kept out of version control.

            `export SOME_SECRET_KEY=1c3-cr3am-15-yummy`

            >>> # Top of settings/production.py
            >>> import os
            >>> SOME_SECRET_KEY = os.environ['SOME_SECRET_KEY']

        - Installing From Multiple Requirements Files

            requirements/
            ├── base.txt
            ├── local.txt
            ├── staging.txt
            └── production.txt

            `pip install -r requirements/local.txt`
    
        - Handling File Paths in Settings

            - XXXX Never Hardcode File Paths XXXX
             
                >>> # settings/base.py
                >>> # DON’T DO THIS! Hardcoded to just one user's preferences
                >>> MEDIA_ROOT = '/Users/pydanny/twoscoops_project/media'
            
            - Instead set a BASE_DIR-like setting with Pathlib

                >>> # settings/base.py
                >>> from pathlib import Path
                >>> BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent

                >>> MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
                >>> STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static_root'
                >>> STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']
